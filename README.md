Game Proposal
3. Concept:

Warrior Adventure is a side-scrolling action shooting game set in the prehistoric age, blending elements of adventure, exploration, and combat. Players will take on the role of a heroic warrior, tasked with traveling through different environments and time periods, hunting dangerous monsters to collect rare plants and ingredients.

4. Description:
In Warrior Adventure, the player controls a brave warrior traveling back in time to the prehistoric age.

As the player progresses through various levels, they must defeat these creatures, explore dangerous environments, collect items, and make use of the powerful items and medicines that can be crafted to fight back against the infection.
The game features side-scrolling gameplay where players use a variety of weapons, strategic planning, and problem-solving to navigate through dangerous levels. The player must also manage an inventory, shop for useful upgrades, and interact with NPCs to unlock new areas and game mechanics. As players advance, they will encounter boss fights, difficult platforming sections, and hidden secrets.


5. Target Audience:
The game is primarily targeted towards children, offering an engaging and family-friendly experience that combines action, adventure, and a touch of educational value about prehistoric times, monsters, and survival.

6. Genre:
Side-scroll shooting with platforming elements. Players will face enemies in action-packed side-scrolling combat, using a variety of weapons, while also solving puzzles, interacting with NPCs, and exploring the environments.

Select character

Warrior Adventure will use the following technology stack and game development tools:
* Game Engine: Unity
* Programming Language: C# (Unity scripting)
* Graphics: Tilemap system for creating environments, along with particle effects for gameplay elements like explosions, weather, and combat effects.
* Sound: AudioSource and AudioManager for background music and sound effects. Audio Volume management for different in-game events and character actions.

Key Features:
1. Tilemap System
* The world and environments will be designed using Tilemap technology, which allows for efficient creation of large, tiled levels that make up the side-scrolling gameplay. These maps will include various terrain types, such as forests, caves, and ruins, all rendered seamlessly to provide an immersive environment.
* 
2. Map Collision - Poly-collision
* The game will use poly-collision to ensure realistic interactions with the environment. Platforms, obstacles, and boundaries will be modeled using polygon-based collision systems to accurately detect player movement and interactions with the environment.
* 
3. Platform Effector
* The platform system will allow for platforms that can be jumped through using Platform Effectors, adding a layer of complexity to the platforming mechanics. Players will need to use this feature to access hidden areas or navigate tricky terrain.

4. Character Control - Scripted
* Player character movement and actions will be controlled through custom scripts that allow for jumping, shooting, running, and other essential player actions. The script will handle animations, physics interactions, and trigger events as the character moves through the world.

5. Coin and Experience Effect - DOTween
* The game will use DOTween for smooth animations, such as the coin collection effects or experience points that float up after a kill. This adds visual flair and provides feedback to the player for in-game progress.

6. Particle Effects
* Various particle effects will be used for explosions, weapon impacts, magic effects, and environmental hazards. This will create a dynamic, engaging visual experience during combat and exploration.

7. Animation
* The game will include animations for character actions, enemies, environmental changes (like weather effects), and interactive elements (such as NPCs or switches). Animations will be designed to match the style and flow of the game.

8. Head-up Display (HUD)
* The HUD will display important player information, including health, ammo, inventory items, and a mini-map. It will also include notifications like coins collected, experience points, and special item pickups.

9. Shop, Inventory, and Item Usage
* Players will have access to a shop where they can purchase upgrades, weapons, and health potions. The inventory system will allow players to collect items, manage them, and use them during gameplay. Items such as healing herbs or weapon upgrades will help the player survive longer in the dangerous world.

10. Dialogue System - Raycast
* Dialogue with NPCs will be handled using Raycast to trigger conversations when the player interacts with certain characters. The conversation system will allow players to learn more about the story, unlock side quests, and receive important information to progress.

11. Cutscenes
* Cutscenes will be used to advance the storyline, provide context, and build the world. They will be triggered at key story moments, such as entering a new level or after completing a significant mission.

13. Interaction
* Interactable Elements will include the ability to collect items, interact with NPCs, and explore dangerous zones. Players will have to avoid or deal with danger zones, such as traps or environmental hazards.
    * Bullets and Projectiles: Combat will feature ranged attacks where the player can shoot projectiles to defeat enemies. These bullets will be affected by physics and collision detection.
    * Camera Follow: The camera will follow the character to ensure the player can see their surroundings, adjusting based on the player's movement and environment.
    * Mini-map: A small mini-map will be available to help the player navigate the world, showing areas they’ve explored, objectives, and enemy locations.

14. Save System - PlayerPrefs
* Player progress will be stored locally using PlayerPrefs, which will save game data such as high scores, achievements, inventory items, and unlocked content. This ensures that players can resume their adventure after taking a break.
